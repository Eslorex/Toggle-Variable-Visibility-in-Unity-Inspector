# ToggleVariableVisibility for ANY script

- Toggles Variables Visibility in Unity Inspector and works for ANY script. You don't need to do anything except;
- You need to define a public bool showVariable to toggle visibility of the variables that has the [HideInInspector] attribute.
- I didn't conduct any testing to identify potential issues that may arise from this code, so please keep that in mind.
