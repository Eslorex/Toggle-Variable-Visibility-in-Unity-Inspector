# Toggle Variable Visibility for ANY script and ANY variable in Inspector

- Toggles Variables Visibility in Unity Inspector and works for ANY script and for ANY variable in Unity. 

- Import the files
- Define a public bool showVariable to toggle visibility of your variables that has the [HideInInspector] attribute. Basically just put [HideInInspector] attribute before the variable if you want to toggle its visibility. I created a script called "Toggle" for you to understand the logic. Be aware that Toggle_2 is also an option.
- Done.

- I didn't conduct any testing to identify potential issues that may arise from this code, so please keep that in mind. Also I plan to bring different feautures to this.
