# Toggle Variable Visibility for ANY script in Inspector

- Toggles Variables Visibility in Unity Inspector and works for ANY script in Unity. 

- Import the files
- Define a public bool showVariable to toggle visibility of your variables that has the [HideInInspector] attribute. Basically just put [HideInInspector] attribute before the variable if you want to toggle its visibility. I created a script called "Toggle" for you to understand the logic.
- Done.

- I didn't conduct any testing to identify potential issues that may arise from this code, so please keep that in mind.
