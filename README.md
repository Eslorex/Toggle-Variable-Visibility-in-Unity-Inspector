# Toggle Variable Visibility for ANY script and ANY variable in Inspector
- Import the files
- Define a public bool showVariable to toggle visibility of your variables that has the [HideInInspector] attribute. Basically just put [HideInInspector] attribute before the variable if you want to toggle its visibility. I created a script called "Toggle" for you to understand the logic. Be aware that Toggle_2 is also an option.
- Done.

- I didn't conduct any testing to identify potential issues that may arise from this code. There is a high potential that this script might cause problems in big projects. So its more like an experiment. Which i hope to fix soon. So please keep that in mind.
